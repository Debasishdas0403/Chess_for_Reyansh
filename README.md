## üéØ How to Play

### Game Controls
- **New Game**: Start a fresh game
- **Undo Move**: Take back the last two moves (yours and bot's)
- **Difficulty**: Adjust AI strength from Beginner to Expert

### Making Moves
1. **UCI Notation**: Type moves like "e2e4" (from e2 to e4)
2. **Dropdown**: Select from available legal moves
3. **Validation**: Invalid moves are rejected with helpful messages

### Understanding the Interface

- **Game Status**: Current turn, move number, and special states
- **FEN Notation**: Technical position description for analysis

## üîß Configuration

Edit `config.json` to customize the application:

```json
{
  "default_difficulty": 4,
  "max_thinking_time": 10.0,
  "enable_opening_book": true,
  "show_thinking_info": true,
  "auto_save_games": true
}
```

### Configuration Options
- `default_difficulty`: Starting AI difficulty (3-6)
- `max_thinking_time`: Maximum seconds for AI to think
- `enable_opening_book`: Use opening move database
- `show_thinking_info`: Display AI calculation details
- `auto_save_games`: Automatically save completed games

## üß™ Technical Details

### Chess Engine Architecture

The AI uses a sophisticated minimax algorithm with several optimizations:

1. **Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning**:
   - Explores game tree to find optimal moves
   - Prunes branches that won't affect the result
   - Typically reduces nodes evaluated by 50%

2. **Position Evaluation Function**:
   - **Material**: Piece values (pawn=1, knight/bishop=3, rook=5, queen=9)
   - **Position**: Piece-square tables for optimal placement
   - **King Safety**: Pawn shield and exposure evaluation
   - **Pawn Structure**: Doubled, isolated, and passed pawn assessment
   - **Mobility**: Piece activity and move availability
   - **Center Control**: Bonus for controlling key squares

3. **Search Optimizations**:
   - **Move Ordering**: Search better moves first for efficient pruning
   - **Transposition Table**: Cache evaluated positions
   - **Iterative Deepening**: Gradually increase search depth
   - **Time Management**: Stop search within reasonable time limits

### Performance Characteristics

| Difficulty | Search Depth | Avg. Nodes | Thinking Time |
|------------|--------------|------------|---------------|
| Beginner   | 3            | ~1,000     | 0.1-0.5s     |
| Intermediate| 4           | ~10,000    | 0.5-2s       |
| Advanced   | 5            | ~50,000    | 2-5s         |
| Expert     | 6            | ~200,000   | 5-10s        |

## üìà Performance Tips

### For Better AI Performance
- **Increase Depth**: Higher difficulty for stronger play
- **Reduce Time Limit**: Faster moves but potentially weaker
- **Disable Opening Book**: Test pure engine strength

### For Better User Experience
- **Stable Internet**: Ensure stable connection for Streamlit Cloud
- **Modern Browser**: Use Chrome, Firefox, or Safari for best performance
- **Desktop/Laptop**: Recommended over mobile for complex games

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Module not found" errors**:
```bash
pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
```

**Slow AI responses**:
- Reduce difficulty level
- Check `max_thinking_time` in config.json
- Ensure sufficient system resources

**Board not displaying**:
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Try refreshing the page
- Ensure Streamlit is running on correct port

**Invalid moves accepted**:
- This shouldn't happen due to validation
- Report as a bug with the game state (FEN)
